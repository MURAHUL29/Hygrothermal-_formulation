# Hygrothermal-_formulation
Formulation of Hygrothermal Expansion Coefficients of the Angle-ply Laminates: 
The changes in temperature and moisture content (i.e., the changes in the hygrothermal environment) are some of the environmental conditions that may influence the mechanical behavior of composites.In some points of view, composite materials can be considered as a structure. Since the angle-ply laminates consist of an equal number of equal-thickness laminae with fiber orientations, the mechanical behavior of the angle-ply laminates will depend on the lamina material properties and fiber orientations as well as lamina hygrothermal effects. However, the lamina hygrothermal effects will depend
on the coefficients of lamina hygrothermal expansion.

In this project, I have developed a program to calculate strain, strain due to thermal elongation, and strain due to moisture content. This program also calculates the total strain in the lamina.
